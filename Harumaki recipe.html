            <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <p>Step 1:Prepare the pork
Take your pork belly or shoulder and roughly cut it. I do this so that my spring rolls have a chunkier texture, but if you are using ground meat you can skip this step.Place it in a mixing bowl with salt, pepper and sesame oil and mix until evenly distributed. </p>
            <p>Step 2:Cook the cabbage
Heat up a pan (one that has a lid) on medium and add the shredded cabbage. Depending on your choice of pan, add a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.Once the cabbage has softened slightly, add chicken stock and sake and place the lid on top. Simmer for 3 minutes and then turn off the heat. </p>
            <p>Step 3:Seal the pork
Heat a large pan on medium-low and add the pork. Stir fry until sealed.</p>
            <p>Step 4:Add aromatics and vegetables
Add the finely chopped fresh ginger and green onion, and stir fry until the ginger becomes fragrant.Once fragrant, add the rest of the vegetables. These should be cut into thin strips (julienne) to make it easier to roll the harumaki later.Stir fry for a few minutes.</p>
            <p>Step 5:Season
Add soy sauce, oyster sauce and sugar to flavor the filling. Mix thoroughly to ensure they’re evenly distributed.</p>
            <p>Step 6:Add the cabbage
Pour the contents of the other pan (cabbage and chicken stock) into the wok and mix well.</p>
            <p>Step 7:Add the noodles
Add the rice vermicelli, make sure they’re submerged in the chicken stock so that they can soften.</p>
            <p>Step 8:Thicken
Once the noodles have softened, take a small bowl and mix 1 tbsp of cold water with 1 tsp of cornstarch to make a slurry. Pour the slurry into the pan and mix well.Simmer until thick and glossy, then remove the pan from the heat.</p>
            <p>Step 9:Cool
Transfer the filling to a wide container and allow it to cool until cool enough to touch.</p>
            <p>Step 10:Cut
Once cool, use scissors to cut the noodles (this will make it easier to divide the filling).</p>
            <p>Step 11:Divide
Divide the filling into portions equal to the number of wrappers you have. This will ensure the size is uniform and you don’t have any leftover filling!</p>
            <p>Step 12:Prepare the station
Take a small bowl and add water and flour at a ratio of 2:1 to make a paste. Place your spring roll wrapper in front of you at a 45-degree angle so that it looks like a diamond.</p>
            <p>Steo 13:Add the filling
Spread the filling horizontally just below the center, making sure not to spread it too close to the edges.</p>
            <p>Step 14:Rap and seal it</p>
            <p>Step 15:fry and Once golden and crispy all over, rest on a wire rack for a few minutes to drain the excess oil.</p>
