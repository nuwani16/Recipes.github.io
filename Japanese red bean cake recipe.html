            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Medium eggs – a crucial ingredient that adds structural integrity and flavor.</li>
                <li>Sugar – I use regular white caster sugar for sweetness, but granulated sugar also works fine. Be careful of brown sugars since this can change the texture and taste of the pancakes.</li>
                <li>Honey – Not only is honey one of the key flavors in dorayaki, but it’s also the acid that reacts with the baking soda to ensure a good rise. Be sure to use the runny variety to make it easy to incorporate into the batter</li>
                <li>Cake flour – Using a weak flour with low gluten will ensure your pancakes are light and fluffy. All-purpose flour works in a pinch but the pancakes might become a little more dense.</li>
                <li>Baking soda – make sure to use baking soda (not baking powder) to ensure a subtle and even rise!</li>
                <li>Water – a small amount of water helps loosen the mixture and improves the texture.</li>
                <li>Cooking oil – use a neutral flavored oil to allow the flavor of the pancakes to shine. I usually opt for simple canola or vegetable oil when making pancakes.</li>
                <li>Red bean paste – for authentic dorayaki, fill them with tsubuan (chunky red bean paste) or koshian (smooth red bean paste). Alternatively, use one of the suggestions below or get creative!</li>

            <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <p>Step 1:Add the eggs, sugar and honey to a mixing bowl and whisk until well combined.</p>
            <p>Step 2:Sift in the cake flour and baking soda directly into the mixture and whisk until there are no more lumps of flour. Be careful not to overmix since this can make the pancakes dense.</p>
            <p>Step 3:Add water to the batter and gently whisk until combined.</p>
            <p>Step 4: Finally, transfer the mixture to a jug (for easy pouring later) and cover it before storing the fridge to rest for 30 minutes..</p>
            <p>Step 5:Start heating the pan on a low heat for about 10 minutes before you plan to start frying. This will ensure the pan is evenly heated without heat spots. Add a small drizzle of oil and spread it around using kitchen paper. This will create an even, non-stick surface without excess oil. If beads of oil are left in the pan, the surface of the dorayaki will become spotty. .</p>
            <p>Step 6:Once the pan is thoroughly preheated and oiled, take the batter from the fridge and pour a few tablespoon’s worth in one spot to ensure it’s perfectly round. Avoid pouring close to the edges of the pan, since this can distort the shape. Pour the pancakes a little smaller than you want them to be, since they will continue to spread for a few seconds. The final size should be about 8cm (3 inches) per pancake. I recommend frying 2-4 at a time depending on the size of your pan. .</p>
            <p>Step 7:Cook for 1 ½ to 2 minutes or until you see bubbles forming on the surface of the pancakes, then carefully peel and flip them using a spatula.Fry on the other side for about 1 minute and then transfer to a plate.Repeat until you’ve used up all of the batter. .</p>
            <p>Step 8:Add about 2 tbsp of red bean paste to half of the pancakes, I recommend packing more in the middle and spreading it a little thinner around the edges to achieve dorayaki’s iconic dome-shape.Place the other half on the pancakes on top and gently press the edges to secure. .</p>
