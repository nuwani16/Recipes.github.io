            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sushi Rice: short-grain Japanese rice known for its stickiness and slightly sweet taste. Used as the base for the sushi roll, it provides a neutral yet flavourful foundation to complement the other ingredients.</li>
                <li>Rice Wine Vinegar: a mild, slightly acidic vinegar made from fermented rice. Mixed with sugar, it adds a tangy and slightly sweet flavour to the sushi rice, enhancing its taste and texture</li>
                <li>Mirin: a Japanese sweet rice wine. Adds sweetness and depth of flavour to the teriyaki glaze, giving it a distinct and delightful taste.</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce (or Tamari for Gluten-Free): a staple in Japanese cuisine, made from fermented soybeans and wheat (tamari is gluten-free, made without wheat). Provides a salty and umami taste to the teriyaki glaze, enhancing the overall flavour profile</li>
                <li>Sugar: used in both the teriyaki glaze and the sushi rice seasoning. Balances the salty and savoury flavours.</li>
                <li>Garlic and Ginger: add aromatic and pungent notes to the teriyaki sauce, enhancing its overall flavour</li>
                <li>Nori Seaweed: a dried seaweed sheet used to wrap the sushi roll. Adds a touch of umami and provides the structural element to hold the roll together.</li>
                <li>Cucumber: add a crisp and refreshing texture to the sushi roll, balancing the sweet and savoury flavours.</li>
                <li>Japanese Mayonnaise (Kewpie): a creamy and slightly sweeter Japanese mayonnaise. Drizzled over the roll as a finishing touch, it adds a rich and delightful creaminess to the sushi.</li>

            <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <p>Prepare The Sushi Rice</p>


            <p>Step 1:Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice following the package instructions or using a rice cooker. Transfer to a bowl. Mix in the rice wine vinegar and sugar. Cover and set aside to cool. </p>

            <P>Prepare The Teriyaki Chicken</P>

            <p>Step 2: In a medium bowl, combine chicken with mirin, soy, sugar, garlic and ginger. Stir to ensure everything is mixed well</p>
            <p>Step 3:Heat up a frying pan on medium heat with olive oil. Pan-fry the chicken until nicely browned and cooked through. Ensure not to burn due to the high sugar content in the sauce. Turn off the heat and transfer the chicken to a plate, allowing it to cool </p>

            <p>Bring It All Together </p>

            <p>Step 4:Lay a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the bamboo sushi mat. Wet your fingers to prevent sticking, then spread an even layer of sushi rice over the nori, leaving about a 1-inch border at the top edge. </p>
            <p>Step 5:Place the cooked teriyaki chicken strips and cucumber strips horizontally along the top of the rice. squeeze 1-2 lines of Japanese mayonnaise over the chicken. </p>
            <p>Step 6:Carefully lift the bamboo mat from the edge closest to you, and use it to start rolling the sushi away from you. Apply gentle pressure to ensure a tight roll. Once the roll is complete, moisten the top border of the nori with a little water to help seal the roll. </p>
            <p>Step 10:Either serve now or cover and refrigerate for 1-2 hours until cold. Using a sharp knife, cut the roll into bite-sized pieces. Arrange the teriyaki chicken sushi rolls on a serving plate. Serve with soy sauce and Japanese mayonnaise for dipping. </p>
